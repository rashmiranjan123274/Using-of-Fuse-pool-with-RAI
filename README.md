# Using-of-Fuse-pool-with-RAI
This article gives brief knowledge about fuse loop and how to borrow token like RAI , Aave .
Hello 
      Everyone in this pool we can get profit from our asset by stake,farm,borrow on the Rari Capital ecosystem holds over $260M in TVL, largely due to the increasing success of Fuse, which contributes $240M alone. If you contribute in this project which is traditional project only for user that they got benefit.
      
 # Lets know about Fuse 
 Fuse is the first truly open interest rate protocol. Lend, borrow, and create isolated lending markets with unlimited flexibility.
It allows users to create a pool, selecting their own assets, interest rate curves, and oracles. Any user can then enter and exit the pools trustlessly without consulting a DAO.Moreover, the ability to lend and borrow any asset is a radical step forward, unlike any other platform in the traditional world. 
Fuse allows users to enter and exit lending and borrowing positions using unique assets and settings. If you have ever use protocols such as Compound or Aave,It operate similarly, but ,it has a new element of customization and present more options which are helpful to user.

# Borrow Token 
First as we know borrow can be done by the user if he/she invest his asset to the pool to earn lending interest or be used as collateral.users can borrow from the same set of assets with some exceptions that will be covered later. Pool creators not only build these sets of assets, but they also choose certain parameters such as Loan to Value ratio. This ratio defines the maximum amount of tokens in the pool that can be borrowed with specific collateral.
**First we need to connect with wallet**

The value showed is that value contribute to the pool by user.After connecting the wallet in the bottom thereare top most project with a great pool.if you want to participate in any pool then simple spend your asset and got profit from it as loan to value ratio LTV more LTV Percentage give you better profit

# BORROW RAI 
After successful connection we can supply eth or any defi token and after supply in the pool we are going to borrow rai and the borrowed token could be use to farm in uniswap by the simple method. As we connect our metamask wallet to fuse or you can use any wallet like trust wallet but i suggest if you could done it by metamask it would better after supply and borrow we can use same wallet to connect with uniswapv3.If you ask us how there are multiple method for doing this. As i know a method we can import our metamask wallet to trust wallet by phase key. After importing the wallet in dapp we can connect our wallet to uniswap and farm our token 
**This seems be like this after supply in verified fuse pool we can borrow and main thing is always use collateral**

After borrow token we go to the uniswap and farm toke as i take rai/dai you can take any pair to farm token

After all these thing as more time you stake or farm token can produce more token.After that you can sell your defi token on uniswap which are staked.
Thank you:)
